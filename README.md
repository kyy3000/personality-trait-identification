When it is tried to run GUI.py at the first time, make sure all data and images is in the right folders and unzipped. In our project, we used Anaconda 3 environment. The GUI’s implementation is built by using Anaconda’s Visual studio code and the code has been ran in the software’s terminal. In the folder requirements_for_GUI.txt is listed all needed libraries which did not come with Anaconda download. If it is tried to launch GUI.py in other environment, make sure that there has been downloaded all recommend files that the first launch error might gives.\

The steps for launch code in Anaconda environment

1. Download Anaconda 3 with Python 3.7
2. Download requirements in Anaconda prompt by using conda command
3. In Anaconda 3 download Visual Studio Code
4. Open personality-trait-identification-master folder  in Visual Studio Code
5. Open file GUI.py and launch the code from button “Run Python file in Terminal”
6. The application window appear and then you can navigate between pages by using buttons
7. When you want to close window, push the cross button from the right corner of the application
