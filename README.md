# Project 17: Personality Trait Identification and Emotion

**Run instructions for the project**\
\
To gain access to the program, download the repository and unzip the file "GUI.zip". In our project, we used Anaconda 3 environment. The GUI’s implementation is built by using Anaconda’s Visual studio code and the code has been ran in the software’s terminal. In the folder requirements_for_GUI.txt is listed all needed libraries which did not come with Anaconda download. If it is tried to launch GUI.py in other environment, make sure that there has been downloaded all recommend files that the first launch error might gives.\
\
The steps to launch the program in Anaconda environment

1. Download Anaconda 3 with Python 3.7
2. Download requirements in Anaconda prompt by using conda command
3. In Anaconda 3 download Visual Studio Code
4. Open the folder where you unzipped "GUI.zip" in Visual Studio Code
5. Locate and open file GUI.py and launch the code from button “Run Python file in Terminal”
6. The application window appear and then you can navigate between pages by using buttons
7. When you want to close window, push the cross button from the right corner of the application

If you receive an error running the program through VS Code try the alternative method:
1. Launch Anaconda Prompt (it came installed with Anaconda 3)
2. Navigate to the folder containing the file GUI.py and run it in python

**The legacy folder**\
This folder contains code and files that were used in various phases of the project but are not mandatory to run the final program.
